# PacmanMazeSearch
A set of algorithms and associated classes to solve mazes similar to pacman

This project was created for assignmnet 1 of CS440-Artificial Intelligence at UIUC. All code was written entirely from scratch, apart from the 2d graphics library StdDraw.java. The project includes...
- File Reader: to parse mazes written as text files
- MazeState: to hold the state of the maze in its many forms
- TreeNode: to abstract a node of the maze to search
- Search: to provide different search algorithms for the maze (BFS,DFS,UniformCostSearch, Greedy, A*)
- Drawing Board: to visualize the maze and search algorithms in 2D graphics
